# Terraform Example and Demos
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

![terraform-lint](https://github.com/oehrlis/terraform/workflows/terraform-lint/badge.svg)

This repository provides a collection of example *terraform* configurations and
modules, which Iâ€™ve created for my presentations at various conferences and user
group meetings. In most cases, the Terraform configurations are for Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure (OCI). Slides and additional information are usually available at
[www.oradba.ch](www.oradba.ch).

## Releases and Versions

You find all official releases and release information on the GitHub
project [release page](https://github.com/oehrlis/terraform/releases). As well
documented in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

The versioning and release tags follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
A version number is specified by MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increase the:

- *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes,
- *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- *PATCH* version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
